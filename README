	==	MICROCOSM	==
	
Microcosm is a proof of concept page for a small-scale message board using Rails. 

The display area has a post-it note bulletin board, which can have up to two message
topics displaying over it. After the user logs-in, the topic list becomes visible. Clicking
on a topic will open it for posting.
